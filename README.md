## 🚀Usage
Once the bot is added to the server, it will require permission to manage roles. 
This is essential for the bot to automatically assign the basic Member role to new users. 
Once this is set up, Hurricane will take care of the rest!

## ❓Why Hurricane❓
Managing a large server can be overwhelming, especially when new users are constantly joining. 
Manually assigning roles to every new user can be tedious. 
With Hurricane, this process is automated—no more wasting time on repetitive tasks.
