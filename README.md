# Hurricane discord bot

## Description

Hurricane is a Discord bot designed to help server administrators manage their communities more efficiently. It automates common tasks, saving time and reducing manual work, especially for large servers.
## Features
 * Auto Role Assignment: Automatically assigns the `Member` role to users as soon as they join the server.

 * Role Management: Requires access to manage roles for proper functionality.

 * Free to Use: Hurricane is completely free and available for all Discord server owners.

## Usage
Once the bot is added to the server, it will require permission to manage roles. 
This is essential for the bot to automatically assign the basic Member role to new users. 
Once this is set up, Hurricane will take care of the rest!

## Why Hurricane
Managing a large server can be overwhelming, especially when new users are constantly joining. 
Manually assigning roles to every new user can be tedious. 
With Hurricane, this process is automatedâ€”no more wasting time on repetitive tasks.
